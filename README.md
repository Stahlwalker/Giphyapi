What it is

This was a school project that had a topic of animals in an array and a create button in the html.  When the user clicks on a button 10 static non-animated animal gif images from the Giphy API will be placed on the the page.  When users click the still giphy images the gif animates.  When the user clicks the animated gif it will return to still.  There is a display rating for each gif (PG, G, so on...) 

The data is provided by Giphy API

Created an input form for users to add new animals to the array.
